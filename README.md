# "What Did You Just Call Me?!" Java identifier validator

# Overview

During my `Java` course at University, I tend to foget the rules of legal identifiers. I created a small program where I may quickly type in my identifier name and receive feedback on it's legality. I plan to expand on this program by adding options to validate identifiers of other programming languages such as C++, Ruby, Python, etc.

### Coding:

This program takes into account the beginning character of the user entered String, checks the rest of the String for special characters, compares the String against keywords, and does not allow for spaces.

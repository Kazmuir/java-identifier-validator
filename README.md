# "What Did You Just Call Me?!" Java identifier validator

# Overview

During my `Java` course at University, I tend to foget the rules of legal identifiers. I created a small program where I may quickly type in my identifier name and receive feedback on it's legality so I never need to wonder or search the rules again.

### Snapshot:

### Coding:

This program takes into account the beginning character of the user entered String, checks the rest of the String for special characters, compares the String against keywords, and does not allow for spaces.

### Future:

I plan to expand on this program by adding options to validate identifiers of other programming languages such as C++, Ruby, Python, etc.
I also want to make an interface in the near future to allow users to enter their identifier along with choosing the language in a form. Anyone can join in if they would like so that we may help students around the world haha.
